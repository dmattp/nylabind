# Objective

Nylabind provides a set of Lua bindings for C/C++ libraries which are compatible with the Nylon/Luabind framework.

Currently provided are bindings for:

* Curses (via Pdcurses for Windows)
* Sqlite
* SQL/ODBC
* OS (linux/windows operating system APIs)
* ZeroMQ
* libzip

# Status

This is currently maintained primarily for the windows environment but should also mostly work for linux if you build manually (no CMake build yet).
